== Description ==
One of the biggest reasons people will leave your website is if it is slow. Heck, they might not even find your website - since one of Google's most important ranking factors is **page speed**.

Data from Google tells us that every second of delay can reduce conversion rates with 20%. That's why we built this tool - so you can make sure you get every conversion you can. 

**WP PageSpeed Score** is developed and maintained by [Grepstad Nilsen](https://www.grepstadnilsen.no/ "Grepstad Nilsen"), a company whose mission is to make digital marketing easy and accessible to everyone.

= Benefits of WP PageSpeed Score =
Now that you know page speed is a super important part of your website success, let us tell you why you should use WP PageSpeed Score.

We use Google Page Speed data and pull it into your Wordpress website. This will tell you how Google and your visitors experience your website. When you run an analysis of your website we will give you tailored recommendations on how to improve your speed. 

When you have fixed the issues you can do the test again and see how much your website experience improved. **So are you ready to make your website faster?**
